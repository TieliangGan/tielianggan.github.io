      <h3>About me</h3>
      <p><b>How do I fall in love with science?</b></p>
      <p>I was born on 8th, September, 1999 in a city called Changsha. My affection for natural science took root in the farms of my grandparents. At that time, I was fascinated by various crops that pop up from the ground and how they can be selected manually for the desired properties. Growing up on a university campus fostered my fascination with the enigmatic yet alluring world of science. When I entered middle school, I had my very first chemistry class and I was immediately enamored with this fascinating kingdom. When I got back home, I set up a small ‘lab’ in our balcony, exploring this fantasy myself. That’s how all the dream started. Over the time, I discovered that my interests truly lay in the field of life science. My personal experiences and the experiences of my relatives afterwards also serve as an essential motivation for my passion. That is why I am now pursuing PhD in this discipline.</p>
      <p><b>My hobbies</b></p>
      <p>Work out can be one of the most-loved activities for me. I have been physical exercising and jogging for almost six years and still planning to go on. Exercise is more to me than just maintaining good health; it has become an integral part of my daily routine. To date, I have finished 2 half-marathons and my weekly training is 6 kilometers of jogging. As for sports, I really love table tennis and badminton, both of which I have been playing for several years.</p>
      <p>Reading, on the other hand, is also my top-loved hobby. On average, I read 15 books per year and among all the genres of books I have read, I love philosophy the most. Now Existentialism is my choice of philosophy, and Simone de Beauvoir and Jean Paul Sartre are my favorite philosophers. As for novels, I love a miscellaneous of genres. For example, Dostoyevsky, Calvino, Camus, Cao Xueqin, Victor Hugo are some of my favorite writers,<i> Crime and Punishment, Jin Pingmei, Hong Loumeng </i>and<i> L’Étranger </i>are some of my most-loved novels. </p>
      <p>As for my other hobbies, watching films and series, visiting Art Galleries and museums, attending musicals are also on the list. These are indispensable activities in my life, and necessary antidote for the pressure that I confront during my academic projects. </p>
      <p><b>My skills</b></p>
      <p>I possess a solid foundation of mathematics and physics knowledge. During my university, I learned Calculus and Linear Algebra for 2 semesters, respectively, and 1 semester each for Probability and Statistics, Mechanics, Optics, Thermodynamics, Electromagnetics, Atomic Physics and C programming Language. I am firmly convinced that in order to do solid research in the scientific field, a broad understanding of these subjects cannot be more important. This can help avoid the perfunctory analysis of the data.</p>
      <p>In 2019, when I was in my third year of university, I realized the significance of programming in our future research. The development of AI will replace many of the work, including some in the natural science world. <b> But I believe that instead of being an ostrich praying for the mercy of the Data-Era, what we really should do is to embrace this trend, making the most of this powerful, unprecedented tool to enhance our study. </b>The prerequisite for this is to learn the programming languages. That is why at that time, I chose to learn Python as a start point, and Linux, algorithms, Machine Learning, Deep Learning and R shortly afterwards. Now in our group, I can operate and maintain our Linux Server, setting up all the environments and exploiting all these bioinformatic tools to enhance and accelerate the research of our group. This is the value computational skills.</p>
      <p>Language is the key to other culture, and a silver bullet for avoiding being narrow-minded. So apart from Chinese, I can also speak English in an almost C2 level, French in an almost C1 level and I can also understand Cantonese.</p>
      <p><b>My Value</b></p>
      <p>My reading, learning and personal experiences shape my own value, and it is now still developing. The most important thing that I believe is to respect. It is not only an action of anti-discrimination. This also includes to respect ALL the value, ALL the different people, and ALL the different choices. Maybe sometimes we can try to influence, sometimes we can like or dislike some certain people, value or choices but at the end of the day, we should not force others to do as we think is right, or despise some value and choices. Like Sartre said, there is no so-called progress, but only the different choices. I believe that is a very important point in the argument ‘existence precede essence’ in the Existentialism. </p>
      <p>I also believe in being proactive. This means to actively learn new things and constantly push myself beyond my comfort zone. I have learned that what seems difficult at first often just requires a single step forward. And once taken, it is often not as daunting as it initially appeared. The benefits of such actions can be tremendous. Just as our metabolism actively reduces the entropy of our bodies, our brains remain clear and civilization progresses through active thinking and reducing the entropy of the chaos within our neurons. History has shown us the consequences of insularity and stasis, and this lesson applies not only to individuals, countries, and science but to civilization as a whole. Just as an ancient Chinese saying goes, ‘Running water does not spoil, but still water breeds rot.’</p>
