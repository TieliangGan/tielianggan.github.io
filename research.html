      Abstract
    </button>
    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> Pyridostatin (PDS) is a well-known G-quadruplex (G4) inducer and stabilizer, yet its target genes have remained unclear. Herein, applying MS proteomics strategy, we revealed PDS signiﬁcantly downregulated 22 proteins but upregulated 16 proteins in HeLa cancer cells, of which the genes both contain a number of G4 potential sequences, implying that PDS regulation on gene expression is far more complicated than inducing/stabilizing G4 structures. The PDS-downregulated proteins consequently upregulated 6 proteins to activate cyclin and cell cycle regulation, suggesting that PDS itself is not a potential anticancer agent, at least toward HeLa cancer cells. Importantly, SUB1, which encodes human positive cofactor and DNA lesion sensor PC4, was downregulated by 4.76-fold. Further studies demonstrated that the downregulation of PC4 dramatically promoted the cytotoxicity of trans-[PtCl2 (NH3 )(thiazole)] (trans-PtTz) toward HeLa cells to a similar level of cisplatin, contributable to retarding the repair of 1,3-trans-PtTz crosslinked DNA lesion mediated by PC4. These ﬁndings not only provide new insights into better understanding on the biological functions of PDS but also implicate a strategy for the rational design of novel multi-targeting platinum anticancer drugs via conjugation of PDS as a ligand to the coordination scaffold of transplatin for battling drug resistance to cisplatin. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>The previous data of our lab shows the function of one of the two zinc finger domains of the autophagy receptor T6BP, the T6BP (725-753) still remains elusive. The mass spectrometry data of T6BP, at the same time, shows significant enrichment of caspase 6, caspase 8 and caspase 14.<a href="http://doi.org/10.1126/science.add6967" target="_blank"> Recent study </a>reveals the potential involvement of T6BP in a newly-discovered anti-apoptosis process as another checkpoint together with caspase 8, FIP200 and ATG9A. Considering the important role of T6BP in autophagy, in combination with our previous data, we speculate that caspase 8, as well as other caspases, may play a role in autophagy. My project is to explore the molecular and cellular mechanisms of these potential interactions.</p></div>

In order to validate our presumptions, I will first use ColabFold on our server to predict the possible structure of the protein complex. Then I will use <i>E. coli</i> to express the procaspase 6, procaspase 8 and their different domains, as well as the zinc finger domains of T6BP. We will use FPLC as the first step to examine the interactions between these domains. In vitro reconstruction of functional caspases will also be conducted. If the interactions do exist, further biochemical characterizations including SEC-MALS, ITC, AUC and so on will be conducted. Protein complex will be reconstructed in vitro to solve the structure by X-ray crystallography or cryo-EM. <br><br>If proven feasible, I will do the cell biology experiments to further elucidate the mechanism of the cross talk. In the process of the experiments, the hypothesis is subject to change.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>53BP1 is mostly well-known for its role in DNA Damage Response. However, in our study of the autophagy receptor T6BP, the mass spectrometry data shows significant enrichment of 53BP1, which leads us to postulate other role of this protein. Recent study from other groups shows that other than the classic role of DNA repair in NHEJ, 53BP1 can also function as <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-28019-y" target="_blank"> regulator of heterochromatin and phase separation</a>and <a href="https://doi.org/10.1038/srep45290" target="_blank"> is involved in mitophagy.</a> Based on these results, we seek to further illustrate the potential role and mechanism of 53BP1 in autophagy. Furthermore, the possibility of autophagy happening in nucleus is also an elusive part in this field.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>As a potential autophagy receptor, I first examined its interaction with the claw domain of FIP200 and with the six proteins in ATG8 family. Then the ITC, AUC and SEC-MALS experiments were carried out to further characterize the biochemical properties of these interactions. At the same time, crystal screen was conducted and the related bioinformatic analysis was also done. <br><br> Co-localization of full length 53BP1 and other related proteins under different conditions is on the way, in combination with other characterization tools such as co-IP, FP, and so on. The hypothesis is subject to change as my experiments are carried out further and further.</p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p>Based on the previous study of the group, pyridostatin (PDS) is able to downregulate the expression of PC4 protein (encoded by <i>SUB</i>1) and stabilize DNA-quadraplex (G4). As a response for DNA damage caused by platinum complex, PC4 protein can bind to the DNA-Platinum complex to rescue the cell from death. Based on these results, we postulate that under the condition of PDS, cells can be more vulnerable to the platinum complex <i>trans</i>-PtTz, thus increase the cytotoxicity of the compound, making it, aside from cisplatin, worth further function as a compound against cancer. </p></div>

    <div class="panel" style="background-color: #F1F1F1; color: #666; padding: 10px;"><p> I first synthesized the compound <i>trans</i>-PtTz, which has two thiazole ring on the <i>trans</i> position. The structure of the molecule was validated by MALDI-MS and NMR. Then, by applying <i>trans</i>-PtTz to HeLa cell culture under the condition of different concentration of PDS, the IC50 of <i>trans</i>-PtTz under this condition, as well as the control group, were determined. Further analysis confirm the downregulation of the gene <i>SUB</i>1 by MS proteomics. <br><br>The result was published on <i>Nucleic Acids Research</i>. </p></div>
